## Methodology

Bluefin was created by engineers, but was brought to life by [Jacob Schnurr](https://www.etsy.com/shop/JSchnurrCommissions) and [Andy Frazer](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/dragonsofwales). The artwork is free for you to use and will always be made by humans. It is there to remind us that open source is an ecosystem that needs to be sustained. The software we make has an effect on the world. Bluefin's AI integration will always be user controlled, with a focus on open source models and tools.

:::tip[AI is an extension of cloud native]

Bluefin's focus in AI is providing a generic API endpoint to the operating system that is controlled by the user. Just as Bluefin's operating system is built with [CNCF](https://cncf.io) tech like `bootc` and `podman`, this experience is powered by [Agentic AI Foundation](https://aaif.io/) tech like `goose`. With a strong dash of the open source components that power [RHEL Lightspeed](https://www.redhat.com/en/lightspeed).

## AI Architecture and Tooling

Bluefin provides open, user-controlled API endpoints to the operating system for AI workflows. We do this via a community-managed set of tool recommendations and configuration:

- "Bring your own LLM" approach, it should be easy to switch between local models and hosted ones
  - [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) as the primary interface to hosted and local models
- Accelerate open standards in AI by shipping tools from the [Agentic AI Foundation](https://aaif.io/), [CNCF](https://cncf.io), and other foundations
- Local LLM service management
  - Model management via `llmman` and Docker Model Runner, your choice
- GPU Acceleration for both Nvidia and AMD are included out of the box and usually do not require any extra setup
- Highlight great AI/ML applications on Flathub in our curated section in the App Store
- A great reason to [sell more swag](https://store.projectbluefin.io)

For deploying reproducible homelab and multi-node AI/observability infrastructure, see [Bluespeed](https://github.com/projectbluefin/bluespeed), Bluefin's homelab factory powered by KubeStellar, Flatcar, and [Knuckle](https://github.com/projectbluefin/knuckle).

We work closely with the [RHEL Lightspeed team](https://github.com/rhel-lightspeed) by shipping their code, giving feedback, and pushing the envelope where we can.

## AI Lab with Podman Desktop

The [AI Lab extension](https://developers.redhat.com/products/podman-desktop/podman-ai-lab) can be installed inside the included Podman Desktop to provide a graphical interface for managing local models:

## llmman

Install [llmman](https://github.com/llmmanorg/llmman) via `brew install llmmanorg/tap/llmman`: manage local models and is the preferred default experience. It's for people who work with local models frequently and need advanced features. It offers the ability to pull models from huggingface, ollama, and any container registry. Check the [llmman documentation](https://github.com/llmmanorg/llmman#readme) for more information.

Use the full `llmman` command in Bluefin, matching the upstream llmman documentation.

llmman's command line experience includes:

```
llmman pull llama3.2:latest
llmman run llama3.2
llmman run deepseek-r1
```

You can also serve the models locally:

```
llmman serve
```

Then go to `http://127.0.0.1:17434` in your browser.

### Integrating with Existing Tools

`llmman serve` will serve an OpenAI compatible endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:17434`, you can use this to configure tools that do not support llmman directly:

### Running AI Agents in VS Code

Here is an example of using devcontainers to run agents inside containers for isolation:

## Docker Model Runner

[Docker Model Runner](https://docs.docker.com/model-runner/) is Docker's built-in local LLM service, included in Bluefin alongside llmman. It runs models from [Docker Hub's AI catalog](https://hub.docker.com/u/ai) and exposes an OpenAI-compatible API — no separate server setup required.

### Installing Docker

Docker is not installed by default, which is why the Docker Model Runner needs a little setup first. To run it — or the rest of the Docker stack, including `docker compose` — install Docker Engine.

The official method adds Docker's repository and installs the full stack, Compose included:

```bash
# Add Docker's official repository
sudo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo

# Install the engine, CLI, and the Compose v2 plugin
sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Start Docker now and on every boot
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

This creates a `docker` group but doesn't add you to it. Add yourself so you can run `docker` without `sudo`, then log out and back in for the group change to take effect:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Verify everything is in place:

```bash
docker version
docker compose version
```

:::tip[Compose is already here]
Because the `docker-compose-plugin` installs the Compose v2 plugin, Compose is available as `docker compose <command>` — no separate `docker-compose` binary needed.
:::

With Docker running, continue below to [pull and run a model](#basic-usage).

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Pull a model from Docker Hub
docker model pull ai/llama3.2

# Run a model interactively
docker model run ai/llama3.2

# List downloaded models
docker model ls

# Remove a model
docker model rm ai/llama3.2
```

### API Endpoint

Docker Model Runner serves an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `http://localhost:12434` that you can use with any tool that supports the OpenAI API format — Goose, aichat, VSCode extensions, and more.

### llmman vs Docker Model Runner

Both provide a local OpenAI-compatible API. Choose based on your workflow:

|               | llmman                              | Docker Model Runner   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Model sources | OCI registries, Ollama, HuggingFace | Docker Hub AI catalog |
| Engine        | Podman                              | Docker Engine         |
| Quick command | `llmman`                            | `docker model`        |

See the [Docker Model Runner documentation](https://docs.docker.com/model-runner/) for the full model catalog and configuration options.

## Alpaca Graphical Client

For light chatbot usage we recommend that users [install Alpaca](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.jeffser.Alpaca) to manage and chat with your LLM models from within a native desktop application. Alpaca supports Nvidia and AMD[^1] acceleration natively.

:::tip[Only a keystroke away]

Bluefin binds `Ctrl`-`Alt`-`Backspace` as a quicklaunch for Alpaca automatically after you install it!
