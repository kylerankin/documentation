# Agentic Bluefin — Contributor Guide

:::info What this guide is for
This guide explains how to contribute to `projectbluefin` — the agentic factory that builds Bluefin. AI agents implement work; humans approve design, review PRs, and run the gates that machine enforcement cannot replace.
:::

## What Changed and Why

Bluefin has been rebooted from `ublue-os/bluefin` — a community-maintained image built by humans — to `projectbluefin/bluefin`, a factory where AI agents implement work and humans approve design, security-sensitive changes, and merges.

The reboot took 4–5 days in late May 2026. As Jorge describes it:

> I did a 4-5 day sprint to rebuild Bluefin with agents. Lots of AI smart people helped me like Andy Anderson, who really explained this. Then it just became obvious. Bluefin 2.0.
>
> — Jorge Castro, _[THEPATTERN](https://github.com/projectbluefin/bluefin/blob/0c41935a077b5fbb8d8367ffe14770f361e78ed2/THEPATTERN.md)_

For a full technical comparison of what changed between `ublue-os/bluefin` and `projectbluefin/bluefin`, see **[THEPATTERN.md](https://github.com/projectbluefin/bluefin/blob/0c41935a077b5fbb8d8367ffe14770f361e78ed2/THEPATTERN.md)**.

## The Factory Is Running

The agentic factory is operational and shipping daily.

**What is operational:**

- Keyless signing, merge queue, fast PR validation (1–2 min)
- `pr-smoke.yml` — full image build + smoke test for PRs that touch build-affecting paths
- `post-testing-e2e.yml` — runs `smoke,common` suites against every push to `testing`
- `nightly.yml` — nightly `smoke,common,vanilla-gnome` baseline run against `:latest`
- `promote-testing-to-main.yml` — daily automated promotion PR into merge queue; `execute-release.yml` publishes `:stable` on push to `main`
- `projectbluefin/actions` shared CI library consumed by `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, and `dakota`
- `bonedigger` issue lifecycle bot
- AI Moderator (`moderator.yml`) — spam detection and moderation on issues and PR comments

**Still in progress:**

- ARM builds — wired in CI, disabled pending akmods ARM support

**What this means for you as a contributor:**

The system is intentionally moving fast. When something breaks, the correct response is to file an issue and fix it. The design assumption is that the gates (2-human approval + e2e + SHA-lock) protect users even while individual components are still maturing.

---

## The System You Are Joining

Bluefin's agentic factory is orchestrated by **[KubeStellar Hive](https://hive.projectbluefin.io/)**, an AI-native continuous delivery system. The architecture looks like this:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph hive["KubeStellar Hive — hive.projectbluefin.io"]
        direction TB

```

### Components

**[KubeStellar Hive](https://hive.projectbluefin.io/)** is the orchestration layer. It manages 8 repositories in the `projectbluefin` org (`bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, `common`, `dakota`, `actions`, `renovate-config`, `bonedigger`, `knuckle`). You can watch it work in real time at [hive.projectbluefin.io](https://hive.projectbluefin.io).

**[bonedigger](https://github.com/projectbluefin/bonedigger)** is the client + lifecycle bot. On Bluefin systems, users run `ujust report` — the agent collects system diagnostics that are hard for humans to gather manually, scrubs PII on-device, and files an issue to the relevant image repository. The GitHub Actions lifecycle bot then manages the pipeline: `filed → approved → queued → claimed → done`.

**kubestellar-bot** is the repo automation layer. It picks up queued issues, dispatches agents to implement fixes and improvements, and ships them back as PRs against the `testing` branch.

**[Project Bluefin MCP](https://mcp.projectbluefin.io/mcp)** (`mcp.projectbluefin.io`) is the public Model Context Protocol endpoint for contributor agents. It provides tokenless access to the org knowledge base and live Hive factory state (`search_knowledge`, `get_factory_status`, `get_work_queue`).

**You** are a human in this system. Your work is approving design, reviewing agent PRs, deciding what to reject, and running the gates that machine enforcement cannot replace.

### Andy Anderson and the ACMM

KubeStellar Hive was designed by **Andy Anderson** — Senior Platform Engineer and Architect at IBM, chief maintainer of KubeStellar for 4 years, and CNCF Sandbox project steward. Hive is the reference implementation for his **AI Codebase Maturity Model (ACMM)**.

The ACMM describes how codebases evolve from basic AI-assisted coding toward fully autonomous systems. The model is structured around 5 progressive levels (arXiv:2604.09388), with a 6th "Fully Autonomous" level introduced for Hive in the paper's Section 5:

| Level | Name                 | Defining feedback loop                                                                                                       |
| ----- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Assisted**         | AI as sophisticated autocomplete — no persistent context or artifacts                                                        |
| 2     | **Instructed**       | Explicit preferences encoded in files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, copilot-instructions.md) yielding reproducible consistency      |
| 3     | **Measured**         | Test suites, coverage metrics, and continuous monitoring infrastructure provide quantitative evaluation                      |
| 4     | **Adaptive**         | Automated responses close feedback loops — auto-tuning, dynamic prioritization, error triage                                 |
| 5     | **Self-Sustaining**  | The codebase becomes a living specification encoding policy and priorities; agents implement with minimal human intervention |
| 6     | **Fully Autonomous** | Hive — the reference implementation (introduced in paper §5)                                                                 |

From the abstract:

> "Each level is defined by its feedback loop topology — the specific mechanisms that must exist before the next level becomes possible. You cannot skip levels, and at each level, the thing that unlocks the next one is another feedback mechanism."

The central finding of the paper:

> **"The intelligence of an AI-driven development system resides not in the AI model itself, but in the infrastructure of instructions, tests, metrics, and feedback loops that surround it."**

### Hive's reported metrics

The numbers below are from the **KubeStellar Console** case study in the ACMM paper and the CNCF blog — an 82-day measurement period.

| Metric                                    | Value                             | Source           |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| PR acceptance rate                        | 81%                               | CNCF blog, arXiv |
| Code coverage                             | 91% across 12 shards              | CNCF blog        |
| CI/CD workflows                           | 63                                | CNCF blog        |
| Nightly test suites                       | 32                                | CNCF blog        |
| Bug-to-merged-fix                         | under 30 minutes                  | CNCF blog        |
| PR throughput gain (Level 2 → Level 6)    | 5×                                | arXiv abstract   |
| Issue throughput gain (Level 2 → Level 6) | 37×                               | arXiv abstract   |
| Hive Bluefin SLA target                   | < 30 min issue-filed to PR-merged | arXiv abstract   |
| Hive Bluefin scope                        | 6 repositories                    | arXiv abstract   |

Specific automations Hive performs (from CNCF blog): repository triage every 15 minutes; PR build monitoring every 60 seconds; error-recovery with exponential backoff; hourly analytics queries for error spikes.

Cross-agent memory continuity in Hive is handled by a system called **Beads** (arXiv abstract).

### A finding that is directly load-bearing for Bluefin

From the case study (CNCF blog):

> _"A flaky test in autonomous workflow is erosion of trust model."_

A single test with 85% reliability cascaded failures across the system. This is why the Bluefin testsuite uses `@quarantine` tags for scenarios that are written but not deterministic — a flaky gate is worse than no gate.

### How the ACMM maps to Bluefin's current implementation

| ACMM level                         | What it corresponds to in Bluefin                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Instructed                         | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/SKILL.md`, `.github/skills/` files in each repo                           |
| Measured                           | Multi-suite testsuite + nightly baseline + 2-human production Environment gate               |
| Adaptive                           | Renovate automerge, AI Moderator, `hive-progress-sync.yml`                                   |
| Self-Sustaining / Fully Autonomous | Active trajectory; KubeStellar Hive managing 8 repos with kubestellar-bot dispatching agents |

The human's role at every level is the same: decide what to build, decide what to reject, define what "good" means. Anderson's paper is explicit on this: "Human oversight remains the source of decisions about what to build, what to reject, and defining quality standards."

## The Four Gates — Where Humans Decide

Agents implement autonomously **except** at these four gates. Stop and request human input when you hit one. If you are a human contributor reviewing an agent PR, these are the moments your judgment is most needed.

| Gate              | When it triggers                                                                                      | What to do                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design Gate**   | Architecture changes, new subsystem design, behavioral changes visible to users                       | Open a draft PR or issue with the proposal. Wait for explicit approval before building.                     |
| **Security Gate** | Auth, signing, supply chain, secrets handling, COPR/third-party sources                               | Stop. Post plainly what you found and what you are proposing. Do not implement until a maintainer approves. |
| **Breakage Gate** | Cross-repo breaking changes — removing/renaming inputs, changing defaults that affect consuming repos | Enumerate the affected repos. Open an issue before touching code.                                           |
| **Merge Gate**    | Final PR approval — always human                                                                      | Agents do not approve their own PRs. Two distinct humans for production builds (machine-enforced).          |

When in doubt, open a draft PR with your implementation and ask explicitly. The system prefers over-communication at gates to silent autonomous action.

---

## The Self-Improvement Loop

Every agent session is expected to produce two outputs:

1. **The work** — the PR, fix, or improvement.
2. **The learning** — what the agent discovered that a future agent should know.

Output 1 without Output 2 leaves the system no smarter. The loop only compounds if agents write back. As the org AGENTS.md states:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    task["Agent works on task"]
    pattern["Discovers pattern,\nworkaround, or convention"]
    skill["Writes to skill file\nin the same PR"]
    commit["Commits\n(skill file included)"]
    next["Next agent starts\nsmarter"]
    loop["Loop"]

    task --> pattern --> skill --> commit --> next --> loop
    loop -->|new task| task
```

### What qualifies as a learning worth writing back

**Write it:**

- A workaround for an upstream bug (include component + issue link)
- A non-obvious pattern required for correctness
- A convention that is not obvious from the code
- Something discovered by trial and error

**Do not write it:**

- One-off task notes ("use commit message X for this PR")
- Obvious things any developer would know
- Ephemeral state ("currently broken, fix pending")

### Where skill files live

| You are working in                     | Write to                                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `projectbluefin/actions`               | `docs/skills/` (Copilot CLI) AND `.github/skills/` (Cloud Agent)       |
| Any other `projectbluefin` repo        | That repo's `.github/skills/` — create if absent                       |
| Cross-cutting (affects multiple repos) | Local first, then open a propagation issue in `projectbluefin/actions` |

### Where to find what needs review

**[queue.projectbluefin.io](https://queue.projectbluefin.io/)** — the Clanker Control Panel — is the live view of everything waiting for a human decision across the org. It shows open PRs bucketed by review state with approval counts, and hive P0/P1 issues in a priority column.

A **machine-readable reviewer briefing** is available at:

**https://queue.projectbluefin.io/review-guide.md**

This document covers: merge rules per repo, what to check in a PR, the four human gates (Design / Security / User Impact / Promotion), hive label taxonomy, repos tracked, and quick-reference shell commands. Agents and humans alike can `curl` this URL to get a structured, parseable briefing without scraping HTML.

The raw data behind the dashboard is also machine-accessible at `https://queue.projectbluefin.io/data.json` (updated every 10 minutes).

### What humans check in review

When reviewing an agent PR, verify:

- Did the agent commit a `.github/skills/` update in this same PR?
- Is the learning described in that update real and non-obvious?
- If a skill file exists for the area worked in, was it updated?

A PR that touches CI, build, or packaging without a skill file update is a yellow flag. Nothing flags it automatically — the skill-drift check was retired — so this is a judgement the reviewer has to make.

### Consuming repos (remain in ublue-os)

| [ublue-os/aurora](https://github.com/ublue-os/aurora)   | KDE variant    |
| [ublue-os/bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite) | Gaming variant |

Aurora and Bazzite consume `projectbluefin/common` but are maintained in the `ublue-os` org. Note the org-wide hard rule: agents must **never** create issues, PRs, comments, or write actions targeting any `ublue-os/*` repository (read-only `gh api` inspections are permitted).

## The Build and Promotion Pipeline

What happens to a change between `git push` and `:stable`:

### What each stage checks

| Stage                                           | What it checks                                                                                                                                       | What blocks it                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `pr-validation.yml` (~1–2 min)                  | `just check`, shellcheck, hadolint, pre-commit, bats unit tests                                                                                      | Any lint failure                   |
| `pr-smoke.yml` (build-affecting PRs only)       | Full image build + smoke test suite — runs when Containerfile, Justfile, image-versions.yml, build_files/, or system_files/ change                   | Build failure or smoke failure     |
| `build.yml` (~26 min)                           | Full image build, all variants; triggered by push to `testing`                                                                                       | Build failure                      |
| `post-testing-e2e.yml`                          | `smoke,common` suites in a QEMU VM via AT-SPI                                                                                                        | Any scenario fails                 |
| `promote-testing-to-main.yml` (daily 04:00 UTC) | Locks testing SHA, verifies e2e, opens squash PR to `main`; auto-merges via merge queue (0 approvals required)                                       | Missing e2e pass or merge conflict |
| `execute-release.yml`                           | Fires on push to `main`; `skopeo copy :testing@<digest> → :latest, :stable`                                                                          | Copy or release failure            |
| `nightly.yml` (02:00 UTC daily)                 | `smoke,common,vanilla-gnome` suites against `:latest` — vanilla-gnome baseline distinguishes Bluefin-specific regressions from upstream GNOME issues | Advisory; does not block merges    |

### What "`:stable`" means under the new model

An image tagged `:stable` has:

1. Passed `smoke,common` automated scenarios in a virtual machine running the exact image being promoted
2. Been built and validated on the `testing` branch
3. Been promoted to `main` via the automated merge queue
4. Been copied from `:testing` to `:stable` by digest, not by tag — the SHA you receive is the SHA that was tested

---

## Filing Work — The Data Donation Model

Bluefin bugs are data donations. The system is designed so that user reports flow directly into the agent pipeline without manual triage.

### The three ujust commands

```bash
# Run on your Bluefin system when you have a bug or question
ujust report

# When you can reproduce a bug someone else reported
ujust confirm <issue-number>

# When a shipped fix works for you — closes the loop
ujust verify <issue-number>
```

`ujust report` runs an agent that collects system diagnostics — logs, hardware info, package versions — that a human would struggle to gather manually. It scrubs PII on-device before filing. The result is a GitHub issue in the relevant image repo with a `bonedigger` label and a diagnostic gist attached.

`ujust confirm` and `ujust verify` are how you record additional real-world hits on an issue. The bonedigger bot uses confirm count as a priority signal. `ujust verify` closes the loop after a fix ships.

**Agent rule when reading issues:** if an issue has `report: attached`, read the gist first. Treat confirm count as a priority signal. Do not bypass the verification loop.

### Issue lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> filed : ujust report\nor manual issue
    filed --> approved : maintainer comments /approve
    approved --> queued : bonedigger schedules
    queued --> claimed : agent or human comments /claim
    claimed --> done : PR merged, ujust verify confirms fix
    claimed --> queued : comment /unclaim
    done --> [*]
```

### Lifecycle bot commands

| Command    | Who              | Effect                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/approve` | Maintainers only | Moves issue from `filed` → `queued`                         |
| `/claim`   | Anyone           | Moves issue from `queued` → `claimed`; assigns to commenter |
| `/unclaim` | Assignee         | Returns issue from `claimed` → `queued`                     |

---

## Branch and Stream Model

### The rule

**All PRs target `testing`.** Never `main`, `stable`, or `latest` directly.

```bash
gh pr create --repo projectbluefin/bluefin --base testing
```

### Branch roles

There are two primary branch roles in the image-producing repositories:

- **Contribution branch:** `testing` — all content PRs target and land on `testing` via squash merge. Image builds trigger on push to `testing` and publish the `:testing` tag.
- **Stable release branch:** `main` — `main` receives squash-merge promotion commits from the automated `auto/promote-testing-to-main` PRs. Push to `main` triggers `execute-release.yml` to publish `:stable` and `:latest`.

### Streams

| Stream  | Tag        | Who uses it                                                |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Testing | `:testing` | Built from every push to `testing`; developers and testers |
| Latest  | `:latest`  | Daily promotion from `main` via `skopeo copy`              | Enthusiasts   |
| Stable  | `:stable`  | Daily promotion from `main` via `skopeo copy`              | Regular users |

### Promotion cadence

Daily at 04:00 UTC (and on push to `testing`), `promote-testing-to-main.yml`:

1. Locks the `testing` HEAD SHA
2. Verifies that `post-testing-e2e.yml` succeeded for that exact SHA
3. Opens or updates `auto/promote-testing-to-main` PR targeting `main`
4. The PR enters the merge queue and auto-merges once required checks pass (0 approvals required)
5. `execute-release.yml` fires on push to `main` and copies `:testing@<digest>` → `:latest` and `:stable` via `skopeo copy` (digest-locked, no rebuild)

If the e2e verification step finds no passing run for the locked SHA, the promotion workflow does not open/advance a PR. No image ships.

### Merge method

Squash merge only. Keep PR branches tidy. The squash commit message is what lands in git history.

## Submitting a Change

### Finding work

```bash
# Open issues labeled for contribution
gh issue list --repo projectbluefin/bluefin --label "good-first-issue"

# All open issues across the org
gh search issues --owner projectbluefin --state open
```

Also see:

- [todo.projectbluefin.io](https://todo.projectbluefin.io/) — work that is new or in progress
- [Monthly Reports](/blog/tags/monthly-report) — recently completed work
- `get_work_queue()` on `https://mcp.projectbluefin.io/mcp` — live ready-to-implement queue directly from Hive

### Agent context via MCP (`mcp.projectbluefin.io`)

Contributor agents query the org knowledge base and factory state via the public MCP endpoint at `https://mcp.projectbluefin.io/mcp`. No token or account is required:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "projectbluefin": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.projectbluefin.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

| Tool                                | Returns                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `search_knowledge(query, limit=10, repo?, since?)` | Matching knowledge entries — patterns, coverage gaps, CI conventions across `projectbluefin/*`. Each hit carries a citation (`repo`, `number`, and `kind`/`state`/`updated` when the source has them); `repo` scopes to one repo, `since` (ISO date) to recent entries |
| `get_factory_status()`              | Live hub health, active contributors, actionable items, per-tier limits                        |
| `get_work_queue(limit=10, repo?)`   | Live ready-to-implement queue and triage counts, plus in-flight triage buckets (implementing, PR open, …) with the lane item and its link; `repo` scopes both |

Guidelines:

- **Search on demand with specific keywords.** Never attempt to load the entire corpus; responses are capped at 25 entries to protect agent context.
- **Read-only.** The endpoint surfaces Hive projections and knowledge entries. Hive alone handles task assignment.
- **Offline fallback.** Local setups can query `~/agent.md` (refreshed via `~/.local/bin/sync-hive-kb`) using `grep`.

### Before opening a PR

```bash
# From the repo root
just check                    # Validates all .just file syntax
pre-commit run --all-files    # Lint, format, shellcheck, actionlint
```

Both must pass. CI will run them anyway; running locally saves the round-trip.

### Commit format

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) is required and CI-enforced.

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Common types: `feat` `fix` `docs` `ci` `refactor` `chore` `build`

```bash
feat(packages): add fzf to base brew
fix(ci): correct digest variable name in reusable-build
chore(deps): update ghcr.io/projectbluefin/common digest to abc123
docs(skills): document dnf-cache key format
```

### AI attribution

If any AI tool wrote or assisted any part of this commit, both trailers are required:

```
Assisted-by: <Model> via GitHub Copilot
Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>
```

This applies to humans using AI tools, not just agents running autonomously.

### SHA pinning for GitHub Actions references

All `uses:` references to external actions must be pinned to a full commit SHA with an inline version comment. Floating tags (`@v3`, `@main`) are not allowed and will fail actionlint:

```yaml
# Correct
- uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2

# Wrong — will fail CI
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### Limits

- Maximum 4 open PRs per agent (enforced by convention, not machine)
- No WIP PRs — open when the work is ready for review
- All PRs squash-merged by maintainers — your branch history does not survive

---

## Reviewing an Agent PR

This is the human's most important contribution to an agentic project. Agents implement fast; your review is the quality gate before the machine gates run.

### What good evidence looks like

Before requesting review, an agent PR should include:

- A link to a CI run, workflow run, or test output that exercises the change
- If no automated test exists, a description of how the change was manually verified
- A skill file update committed in the same PR (not a follow-up)

### The skill file check

Look at `.github/skills/` in the PR diff. Ask:

- Did this change touch CI, build scripts, or non-obvious configuration?
- If yes, is there a skill file covering this area?
- If yes, was it updated in this PR?

Nothing warns you automatically about code changes landing without a skill update; the skill-drift check was retired. When you spot one, decide whether the omission is justified (a one-liner with nothing non-obvious) or a gap that will cost a future agent time.

### Red flags

| Signal                                                 | What it means                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PR description is a diff summary                       | Agent narrated what it did, not why; the why belongs in the commit message |
| No CI run linked, no verification                      | Evidence of work is missing; do not approve                                |
| Non-trivial CI change with no skill update             | Future agents will repeat the same trial-and-error                         |
| `@quarantine` tag removed without a measured pass rate | Premature — a flaky gate is worse than no gate                             |

### PR comment policy

- One comment per PR event, maximum — combine all findings
- Do not duplicate what the GitHub UI already shows (approval status, CI green/red)
- Test reports: what ran, pass/fail count, blockers only — no diff summaries
- `@mentions` only when asking for a specific action from a specific person
- When in doubt, post nothing

---

## Testing Your Change

### Automatic smoke testing on build-affecting PRs

PRs that touch `Containerfile`, `Justfile`, `image-versions.yml`, `build_files/`, or `system_files/` automatically trigger `pr-smoke.yml`, which builds the image and runs the smoke suite. Results appear as a required check on the PR. You do not need to do anything — the check runs automatically.

### The `/e2e` command

On any open PR, a maintainer can comment:

```
/e2e
```

This triggers `e2e-dispatch.yml`, which:

1. Builds the PR image
2. Runs smoke + developer + vanilla-gnome suites against it
3. Posts results back to the PR

Use this for extended testing on changes where `pr-smoke.yml` alone is insufficient.

### Switching to a PR image

Every PR that touches image paths generates an OCI artifact. To test it on a running Bluefin system:

```bash
# Find the PR number
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin:pr-<NUMBER>
sudo systemctl reboot

# If it works — leave a ujust verify comment on the PR
# If it doesn't work — revert
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin:testing
sudo systemctl reboot
```

### Local build

```bash
# Local build (no sudo required)
just build bluefin latest main

# CI-equivalent build (requires sudo, uses buildah)
sudo just build-ghcr bluefin testing main
```

### What the testsuite covers

[`projectbluefin/testsuite`](https://github.com/projectbluefin/testsuite) — running on standard `ubuntu-latest` GitHub Actions runners via QEMU + KVM. No self-hosted hardware required.

Scenarios tagged `@quarantine` are present in the repo but excluded from the promotion gate. Do not remove a `@quarantine` tag until the scenario has a demonstrated pass rate suitable for blocking promotion.

## Working with Renovate

Renovate runs on a self-hosted configuration from [`projectbluefin/renovate-config`](https://github.com/projectbluefin/renovate-config) — GitHub App auth, no PATs.

**What Renovate automates:**

- Base image digest bumps (Containerfile ARG digest pins)
- GitHub Actions SHA pins (updating commit hashes with version comments)
- Container image digest updates in `image-versions.yml`

**Automerge:** `renovate-automerge.yml` automatically merges passing Renovate PRs for low-risk updates (digest bumps where package list is unchanged). High-risk Renovate PRs (labeled `renovate/high-risk`) wait for `pr-smoke.yml` to pass before automerge. These automated updates represent a large fraction of all commits.

**When Renovate conflicts with your PR:**

```bash
git checkout your-branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/testing

# Resolve conflicts if any
git add resolved-file
git rebase --continue

# Force push (your branch, your PR)
git push origin your-branch --force-with-lease
```

## Becoming a Maintainer

### Human decision gates in the automated factory

While daily promotions through the merge queue are automated when tests pass, human maintainers remain the ultimate decision gate across the factory:

- **Design decisions**: Significant architectural choices are recorded in `adr/` and reviewed by maintainers before implementation.
- **Security reviews**: Secrets, tokens, credentials, and sensitive permissions are strictly controlled by humans.
- **Sensitive path review**: Changes touching `.github/workflows/`, `Justfile`, and `build_files/` require maintainer approval.
- **Merge queue oversight**: Managing queues, resolving blockers, and approving manual releases.

Being a maintainer means exercising judgment over architecture and safety while letting automation handle routine execution.

### Qualities

There is no formal application process. Maintainer status emerges from demonstrated contribution:

- Consistent quality PRs over time
- Good judgment in review comments — not just "LGTM"
- Helpful to other contributors without being asked
- Understands the project's quality bar and says no when warranted
- Responsive and reliable

### Issue capture discipline

Discord is for rapid iteration. GitHub is for permanent knowledge. After a Discord debugging session:

1. Copy findings to a text editor as you go
2. File an issue with: symptoms, root cause, solution, related links
3. Cross-reference the issue from Discord so future searchers find it

Discord messages disappear from search. GitHub issues do not.

### Theming your hive profile card

The hive's leaderboard can load a stylesheet from a public GitHub repository, so
your contributor card can carry the project's colours instead of a generic
palette. Bluefin publishes one:

```text
https://hive.projectbluefin.io/contribute/leaderboard?style=projectbluefin/documentation/static/hive/leaderboard.css@main
```

The `?style=` parameter takes `owner/repo/path/theme.css@ref`. Omit `@ref` to
track the repository's default branch. The hive fetches the file server-side
from `raw.githubusercontent.com`, which keeps its Content-Security-Policy intact
and keeps your IP address away from third parties, then sanitizes the result and
caps it at 128 KiB.

To write your own, copy
[`static/hive/leaderboard.css`](https://github.com/projectbluefin/documentation/blob/main/static/hive/leaderboard.css)
and change the colours. The sanitizer is stricter than it first appears, and
each of these was verified by fetching the sanitized result back and diffing it
against what was sent. It rejects a whole rule if any declaration in it is
disallowed:

- **No `@import` and no `url()`.** A stylesheet that can fetch is a stylesheet
  that can exfiltrate.
- **No at-rules at all**, `@media` included. You cannot branch on
  `prefers-color-scheme` or `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **No custom properties.** A rule containing `--anything: value` is dropped
  whole, so a theme cannot define its own variables — and cannot set
  `--me-accent` either, even though that is how the hive's built-in styles
  work. Use literal colours.
- **No gradients.** `linear-gradient()` does not survive.
- **No ancestor selectors.** Rules are scoped by prepending `#tab-leaderboard`,
  so `[data-theme="light"] .me-card` becomes
  `#tab-leaderboard [data-theme="light"] .me-card`, and the hive sets
  `data-theme` on `<html>` — above that scope, so it can never match.

The last two together mean **a theme cannot branch on light versus dark**. Pick
one palette that clears contrast on both hive surfaces, `#161b22` and
`#f6f8fa`, rather than writing rules that are silently discarded. Bluefin's
theme uses `#5c7bd1` at 4.29:1 and 3.79:1 respectively.

Changes take up to five minutes to appear: the hive caches the fetched
stylesheet with `max-age=300`.

An unfetchable or invalid stylesheet falls back to the default with a notice, so
a mistake here degrades quietly rather than breaking the page.

## Glossary

**nightly** — `nightly.yml` — runs at 02:00 UTC daily against `:latest`. Runs `smoke,common,vanilla-gnome` suites. The vanilla-gnome baseline separates Bluefin-specific regressions (smoke fails, vanilla-gnome passes) from upstream GNOME regressions (both fail). Advisory; does not block merges.

**pr-smoke** — `pr-smoke.yml` — full image build + smoke test triggered automatically on PRs that touch build-affecting paths (Containerfile, Justfile, image-versions.yml, build_files/, system_files/). Required check for high-risk Renovate automerge. Distinct from `/e2e` dispatch.

**ACMM** — AI Codebase Maturity Model. A 5-to-6-level framework (Anderson, arXiv:2604.09388) describing how codebases evolve from AI-assisted to fully autonomous. Each level is defined by its feedback loop topology.

**Assisted-by** — Required commit trailer for any AI-assisted contribution, paired with the Copilot Co-authored-by trailer.

**Beads** — KubeStellar Hive's system for cross-agent memory continuity (arXiv:2604.09388).

**bonedigger** — The Bluefin client + lifecycle bot. Client side: `ujust report/confirm/verify`. Bot side: GitHub Actions that manage the `filed → approved → queued → claimed → done` pipeline.

**@quarantine** — Test scenario tag meaning the scenario is written and committed but excluded from promotion gates because its pass rate is not yet reliable enough.

**kubestellar-bot** — The repo automation layer in KubeStellar Hive. Picks up queued issues, dispatches agents, ships PRs.

**mcp.projectbluefin.io** — Public Model Context Protocol endpoint (`https://mcp.projectbluefin.io/mcp`) providing contributor agents with tokenless access to org knowledge (`search_knowledge`), live factory status (`get_factory_status`), and the Hive work queue (`get_work_queue`).

**Hive** — KubeStellar Hive, the reference implementation for ACMM Level 6. Orchestrates the Bluefin agentic factory. Live dashboard: [hive.projectbluefin.io](https://hive.projectbluefin.io).

**SHA-lock** — The promotion workflow's property that the image digest at the start of promotion must equal the digest at the end. Prevents a rebuild from silently changing what was tested.

**skill file** — A Markdown file in `docs/skills/` (or `.github/skills/`) documenting non-obvious patterns, workarounds, and conventions. Required to be updated (or created) in the same PR as the work that discovered the learning.

**skill-drift** — The gap between what a skill file documents and what the code currently does. Formerly detected by the `skill-drift-check.yml` workflow and the `skill-audit.yml` cron; both were retired after the check decayed into a no-op that always passed. It is now caught in review and by the self-repair loop.

**testing stream** — The `:testing` tag. Built from every push to `testing`. This is what developers and testers run. All PRs target the `testing` branch.

**promotion gate** — The automated `promote-testing-to-main.yml` daily workflow that verifies passing e2e runs on `testing`, opens a squash PR to `main`, and auto-merges via the merge queue.

**ujust report / confirm / verify** — The three data-donation commands. `report` files a new issue with diagnostics. `confirm` records another real-world reproduction. `verify` closes the loop after a fix ships.
